DCDOT VDS Data Visualization Applications
====

This project is dedicating on providing some state of the art visualization techniques for the transportation agencies. Such visualization techniques are user friendly and easy to use. 

## Development Environment
This system is integrated under Flask framework. MSSQL is deployed as backend database. Tools such as Twitter [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) are utilized for front end visualization. 

Tools and Environment:
* Python Flask
* MSSQL 2008 R2
* jquery, jquery UI, leaflet
* D3.js, Highcharts 

### Map Timeline
Front end UI is inspired by [Christchurch 2010 Timeline](http://bl.ocks.org/tnightingale/4718717). 
[leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is used for map display and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is used for timeline and data points display.
